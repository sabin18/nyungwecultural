    description:"Tea was introduced in Rwanda in 1952 and is now one of the country’s largest exports. The fertile volcanic soil and temperate climate make for perfect tea growing conditions.The majority of tea is cultivated on large plantations, with a small contribution from tea cooperatives and private growers. Tea plants can be seen covering the rolling hills, their rich green a striking contrast to the blue skies, dirt roads and sunshine.Tea leaves are processed in a dozen tea factories across the country. A number are open to the public, enabling visitors to discover how tea is harvested and processed, with the opportunity to taste the results.Tea plantation tours take place in a variety of locations across Rwanda, with the major ones being around Nyungwe National Park – Gisovu and Gisakura.Tucked away at the far northern edge of Nyungwe National Park, the shimmering fields and winding pathways of the Gisovu Tea Estate sit right up against the primeval Nyungwe forest, where the meticulous rows of tea draw a sharp contrast with the wild forest greenery just behind them.The estate offers both day tours and accommodation, so after a tour of the grounds and cupping ceremony, those with time to spare can unwind here, mountain bike through the grounds, or simply soak up the serenity over never-ending cups of the world’s finest tea.Hugging the undulating hills at the western fringes of Nyungwe Forest National Park, the Gisakura Tea Estate is among the most famous of Rwanda’s tea plantations, and certainly among the most beautiful. Tours and tastings are easily arranged, and while there is currently no accommodation on the plantation itself, there are guesthouses just a short walk or drive away.Keep an eye out for the troop of Colobus monkeys which live in a patch of forest within the plantation.",

    description:"Nyungwe is one of the oldest rainforests in Africa, and the largest expanse of forest in Rwanda, covering 1,019 km2 of dense Afromontane forests, bamboo-covered slopes, grasslands and wetlands. The park feeds two of the world’s largest rivers, the Congo and the Nile, and provides a significant portion of Rwanda’s freshwater. Over 1,100 recorded plant species, 345 bird species and 85 known mammal species, including 13 of Africa’s primates – notably, chimpanzee, Ruwenzori black-and-white colobus and L’Hoest’s monkeys – are found in this exceptional landscape. Historically, Nyungwe’s rich fauna and flora was exposed to rampant poaching, illegal mining, unsustainable harvesting and agricultural encroachment, endangering the survival of its rich biodiversity. Following a successful partnership with the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) in Akagera National Park, in 2020 African Parks was invited by the Rwandan government to sign a 20-year agreement to manage Nyungwe. Together, we are working to restore and protect wildlife, engage with the local communities, and develop a strong tourism offering to improve economic sustainability of the park. Today, the park is building a sense of ownership of conservation among the people who live around it, and developing an ecologically healthy and financially self-sufficient asset",

According to oral tradition, it was the site of battles and power struggles.For a long time, the monarchy was mobile, moving the court between various locations.

The capital of the kingdom had as many as 2,000 inhabitants, and huts built with the same methods as seen here.At the back live a few long-horned Inyambo cattle, descended from the king’s herd, whose keepers carefully tend and sing to them, keeping alive a unique tradition.The elegant cows, derived from the wider Ankole breed, played an important role during ceremonies in honour of the king. They were decorated with rich jewellery, and were taught to listen to a trainer’s songs and follow his movements in a stately parade.Rwanda ceased to be a monarchy in 1962, when it gained independence from colonial rule. However, the breeding and grooming of Inyambo is still carried out under the Rwanda Agriculture Board.",
